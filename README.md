# React Hooks

A collection of general purpose, side-effect free, hooks that can be used in React apps.  It is tested with React and React Native.

This targets React 16 to make it work with Expo 42.

## Origin

Originally this was *React Hook Tests* which is a bunch of hooks I wrote to learn how to use React hooks and have associated jest tests with it and attempt to get a [good test coverage](https://trajano.github.io/react-hooks/lcov-report/).
